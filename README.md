## Compiling C++
If you have bash, you're in luck. Otherwise, you'll have to find another method.

- Make bash script executable

<small>If you're using the Bash terminal, you can skip this step. This step is only necessary if you're using ZSH or FISH.</small>

```bash
chmod +x compile.bash
```
- Compile
```bash
./compile.bash --help
```

Alternatively, you can run directly with bash
```bash
bash compile.bash --help
```
