# Problem J1: Quadrant Selection #
## Time limit: 1 second ##

## Problem Description ##
A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in. There are four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4, as shown in the diagram below: <br/>
Quadrant 2 | Quadrant 1 <br/>
------------|----------- <br/>
Quadrant 3 | Quadrant 4 <br/><br/>
Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be ```0```.
## Input Specification ##
The first line of input contains the integer ```x``` (```-1000``` <= ```x``` <= ```1000```; ```x``` != ```0```). The second line of input contains the integer ```y``` (```-1000``` <= ```y``` <= ```1000```; ```y``` != ```0```).
## Output Specification ##
Output the quadrant number (```1```, ```2```, ```3``` or ```4```) for the point (```x```; ```y```).
